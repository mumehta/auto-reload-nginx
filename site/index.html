    <main>
        <p>Now in your fifties, the parents have passed
            to that passive phrase, that elusive place.
            The branches you bent to find your way home
            have disappeared. Taken by blight or overgrowth.
            With the grinning blade of the butcher knife,
            you lean into the proverbial forest,
            worry not how you will eat, but how to hunger.</p>
        

        <p>You start by building a lean-to, discover
            that perfect branch you mistake for the forest
            welcoming you. Survival, a man once said, depends
            on clear-cutting everything thicker than your thumb,
            thinner than your wrist. Surprise what’s coming.
            Sun what’s fruiting.</p>
        

        <p>Instead, you
            slingshot stones at storm clouds
            also thickening in the middle with age.
            Pickle yourself with tannic acorns
            until teeth crumb into orange dust.
            Razor ankles with maps of yesterday.
            Like Now and its friend Then,
            you avoid thinking of your parents
            tucking you in with the advice, “Everything
            will be all right.” You know they didn’t
            believe their words, yet you repeat them
            like a cardinal’s churlish chirp.</p>
        

        <p>You follow
            the impulse that lures you to birdcall
            and green leaf, to lean-tos and chop-downs,
            to ivy and itch. It’s the same instinct
            that has always throbbed: eat, write,
            move, love, fight—until you join them.</p>
